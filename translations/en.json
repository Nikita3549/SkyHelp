    "DelayedBaggageCompensation_faq_q1": "What's the difference between delayed and lost baggage?",
    "DelayedBaggageCompensation_faq_a1": "Baggage is considered \"delayed\" when it doesn’t arrive with your flight but the airline knows where it is and expects to deliver it to you. Most airlines consider baggage \"lost\" if it hasn’t been found within 21 days. The compensation approach differs: for delayed baggage, you can claim essentials while waiting; for lost baggage, you claim for the full value of the luggage and its contents.",
    "DelayedBaggageCompensation_faq_q2": "Can I claim for emotional distress caused by lost luggage?",
    "DelayedBaggageCompensation_faq_a2": "Generally, no. The Montreal Convention limits compensation to material damages and doesn’t provide for compensation for emotional distress or inconvenience. Your claim should focus on the actual financial losses incurred due to the baggage issue, such as the value of lost items or costs of essential purchases while waiting for delayed baggage.",
    "DelayedBaggageCompensation_faq_q3": "What if the airline offers vouchers instead of cash compensation?",
    "DelayedBaggageCompensation_faq_a3": "Airlines often try to offer vouchers for future flights instead of cash compensation. You are not obligated to accept this offer. Under the Montreal Convention, you are entitled to monetary compensation for your losses up to the maximum liability limit. If you prefer cash compensation, you can insist on this and reject voucher offers.",
    "DelayedBaggageCompensation_faq_q4": "Does travel insurance cover what airlines don’t?",
    "DelayedBaggageCompensation_faq_a4": "Yes, comprehensive travel insurance often provides additional coverage beyond airline liability limits. Many policies include higher compensation limits for baggage and may cover items that airlines typically exclude (like electronics or jewelry). They may also offer immediate emergency funds for essential purchases without waiting for airline reimbursement. Always check your policy details before traveling.",

    "FlightCompensation.faqs.claimCompensationBoth.question": "Can I claim compensation for both a delayed and cancelled flight?",
    "FlightCompensation.faqs.claimCompensationBoth.answer": "No, you cannot claim twice for the same disrupted journey. EU261 entitles you to compensation once per disrupted journey, not for each individual issue that occurred. The compensation is calculated based on the total delay at your final destination, regardless of whether it was caused by a delay, cancellation, or combination of issues.",
    "FlightCompensation.faqs.entitledIfAlternativeFlight.question": "Am I entitled to compensation if I was offered an alternative flight?",
    "FlightCompensation.faqs.entitledIfAlternativeFlight.answer": "Yes, you can still be entitled to compensation even if you accepted an alternative flight. The key factor is how much later you arrived at your final destination compared to your original schedule. If the replacement flight got you there 3+ hours late, you're likely eligible for compensation, even if you accepted the airline's alternative travel arrangements.",
    "FlightCompensation.faqs.reroutedDifferentCity.question": "What if I was rerouted through a different connecting city?",
    "FlightCompensation.faqs.reroutedDifferentCity.answer": "Being rerouted through a different connecting city doesn't affect your right to compensation if you still arrived at your final destination 3+ hours late. The route taken is irrelevant for compensation purposes - only the delay at your final destination matters. If the airline got you there via a completely different path but still late, you maintain your right to compensation.",
    "FlightCompensation.faqs.claimPackageHoliday.question": "Can I claim if my flight was part of a package holiday?",
    "FlightCompensation.faqs.claimPackageHoliday.answer": "Yes, flights that are part of package holidays are fully covered by EU261. You have the same rights as any other passenger. However, you may need to direct your claim to the tour operator rather than the airline, depending on your specific booking arrangements. The tour operator is responsible for assisting you with your claim against the airline.",
    "FlightCompensation.faqs.needLawyer.question": "Do I need a lawyer to claim flight compensation?",
    "FlightCompensation.faqs.needLawyer.answer": "No, you don't need a lawyer to claim flight compensation. You can submit a claim directly to the airline yourself. However, if the airline refuses to pay or ignores your claim, you might consider using a specialized flight compensation company like SkyHelp to handle your case. These services work on a no-win, no-fee basis and have expertise in dealing with resistant airlines.",

    "MissedConnectionCompensation.faq.a1": "No, security lines are the responsibility of the airport, not the airline. You're only entitled to compensation when the missed connection is due to an airline-related issue, like a delay or cancellation of your first flight.",
    "MissedConnectionCompensation.faq.q2": "What if I booked my flights separately?",
    "MissedConnectionCompensation.faq.a2": "If you booked separate tickets for each flight (even with the same airline), they're considered separate contracts. If your first flight is delayed and you miss your second flight, the airline operating the second flight has no obligation to rebook you or provide compensation, as they fulfilled their contract.",
    "MissedConnectionCompensation.faq.q3": "Does the minimum connection time affect my compensation rights?",
    "MissedConnectionCompensation.faq.a3": "When booking a single reservation with connecting flights, airlines are responsible for providing sufficient connection time. If the connection time meets the airline's minimum requirement but you still miss your connection due to a delay, you're still eligible for compensation, regardless of how short the connection time was.",
    "MissedConnectionCompensation.faq.q4": "What happens if my rerouted flight also gets delayed or cancelled?",

    "strike.faq.title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "strike.faq.q1.question": "Can I get compensation for flights disrupted by air traffic control strikes?",
    "strike.faq.q1.answer": "Generally, no. Air traffic control strikes are considered \"extraordinary circumstances\" beyond the airline's control, so financial compensation typically isn't required. However, you're still entitled to care (meals, accommodation) and either a refund or re-routing, regardless of the strike cause.",
    "strike.faq.q2.question": "What evidence do I need to support my strike-related claim?",
    "strike.faq.q2.answer": "Gather as much documentation as possible: your boarding pass, booking confirmation, communications from the airline about the disruption, news articles about the strike (specifying who was striking), receipts for any expenses, and documentation of when you finally arrived at your destination.",
    "strike.faq.q3.question": "What if I was notified about the strike weeks in advance?",
    "strike.faq.q3.answer": "If the airline notified you more than 14 days before your scheduled departure and offered alternative arrangements, you typically won't be eligible for compensation. However, you're still entitled to a full refund if you choose not to take the alternative flight.",
    "strike.faq.q4.question": "Can airlines refuse care and assistance during strikes?",
    "strike.faq.q4.answer": "No. Regardless of whether the strike is considered an \"extraordinary circumstance,\" airlines have a duty of care to passengers during disruptions. This includes providing meals, refreshments, communication facilities, and accommodation if necessary. This is a separate obligation from compensation.",
    "strike.faq.q5.question": "What if my flight was re-routed due to a strike but arrived late?",
    "strike.faq.q5.answer": "If your alternative flight arrived at your destination with a delay of 3+ hours, and the strike was by airline staff, you may still be entitled to compensation. The key factor is the total delay in reaching your final destination compared to your original schedule.",

    "Uk261Faq.answer1": "UK261 applies to flights departing from UK airports regardless of the airline, and flights arriving in the UK only if operated by UK or EU carriers. This creates an important distinction from EU261, which covers flights departing from EU airports or arriving in the EU on EU carriers.",
    "Uk261Faq.question2": "What if my flight is disrupted due to extraordinary circumstances?",
    "Uk261Faq.answer2": "Like EU261, UK261 exempts airlines from paying compensation if the disruption was caused by extraordinary circumstances that could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken. These include severe weather, political instability, security risks, air traffic control restrictions, and unexpected flight safety shortcomings. However, the airline must still provide care and assistance during the disruption.",
    "Uk261Faq.question3": "How soon after a disruption should I file a UK261 claim?",
    "Uk261Faq.answer3": "While you have up to 6 years in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland (5 years in Scotland) to file a claim, it's advisable to submit your claim as soon as possible. This makes it easier to gather and provide all the necessary documentation and increases your chances of a successful outcome.",
    "Uk261Faq.question4": "Can I claim under both UK261 and EU261 for the same disruption?",
    "Uk261Faq.answer4": "No, you cannot claim compensation twice for the same disruption. You need to determine which regulation applies to your specific journey. For flights between the UK and EU, either UK261 or EU261 will apply depending on the direction of travel and the airline's nationality.",
